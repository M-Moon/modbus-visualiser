# Modbus Creator

An application used to easily and quickly construct the layout of a modbus, save
the configuration, and output the configuration into different parsable and readable
formats to make understanding the modbus easier.

It will also work to create a JSON config that can be used to setup a simulator
for the modbus using the [PyModbus](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus)
library.
